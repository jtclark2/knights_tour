TODO: Future Improvements:
    - Add comments (I wrote this, and don't understand half of what is happening anymore)
        - simplify...I wrote some verbose stuff, and it can be much much cleaner
    - Create Enums for all the special objects (currently uses characters)
    - Clarify entry point: Make the solutions to the original pdf explicit and easy to find (they're kind of buried in testing right now)
    - rename node...or maybe I should leave it? I don't know, atleast standardize with the GridPos class
