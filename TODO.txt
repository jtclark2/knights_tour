TODO: Future Improvements:
    - Create Enums for all the special objects (currently uses characters)
    - Split testing into separate file(s)
    - Clarify entry point: Make the solutions to the original pdf explicit and easy to find (they're kind of buried in testing right now)
    - Add test coverage (pytest-cov)
