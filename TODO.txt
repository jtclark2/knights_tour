TODO: Future Improvements:
    - Fix the imports...they work, but with bad practices. I've set the linter to ignore them for now.
    - Consider adding a heuristic to plan_path()...though it's already basically instantaneous for a 32x32 board
        - This would basically turn it into A-star
    - Each heuristic performs wonderfully in context. You could create a "smart conext" mapper that determined specific
      heuristics to use in certain regions. It would be a lot of fun, but way beyond the intended scope of this project.

    Very low priority:
    - Consider adding the 3rd pattern to the barrier-check (or not, I kind of like it this way too)
    - Expand teleport functions...if you're bored
    - Tests need an overhaul...which I probably won't do unless I actively modify the function of the associated code
