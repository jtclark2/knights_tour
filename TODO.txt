TODO: Future Improvements:
    - Split testing into separate file(s)
    - Use numpy (why did I use nested lists to begin with?)
    - Decouple board display from internal representation
    - Clarify entry point: Make the solutions to the original pdf explicit and easy to find (they're kind of buried in testing right now)
    - Add test coverage (pytest-cov)
