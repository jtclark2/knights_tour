# KnightBoard Problem Statement
This repo addressing a series of increasingly complex maze/pathfinding problems, which can be 
treated as heuristic searches.

Complexity increases with each problem, adding obstacles, teleports, etc.

See KnightBoard.pdf for detailed coding prompt. (This was originally a take home problem. It
was not my own; however, I can't remember the source now)
