# KnightBoard Problem Statement
This repo addressing a series of increasingly complex maze/pathfinding problems, which can be 
treated as heuristic searches.

Complexity increases with each problem, adding obstacles, teleports, etc.

See KnightBoard.pdf for detailed coding prompt. (This was originally a take home problem. It
was not my own; however, I can't remember the source now)

# Setup
Create new env, and run `make all`. This will run the install scripts and a bunch of other checks.


# Future Improvements:
There are Todo's noted throughout the code, but nothing critical. Just tweaks for fun, that I might add
if this project grew into a real game.
